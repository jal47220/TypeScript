# TypeScript

This repo showcases learnings from an introductory Udemy course on TypeScript.

TypeScript files are separated by topic.

In order to run the code in any browser, import the codebase to your local machine, then you only need to navigate to the project folder and run **npm start** in the console. This will open a window in your browser, in which you can open dev tools for the browser to view console output.

If you are making local changes to this code, it is best to have another console open that is running **tsc -w**, which will automatically re-compile the code to your browser any time a file is altered and saved.
